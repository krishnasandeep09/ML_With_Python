"The best classifier" assignment from Machine Learning with Python course by IBM in Coursera

Loads a historical dataset from previous loan applications, cleans the data, and applies different classification algorithm on the data. The following algorithms are used to build the models:

    k-Nearest Neighbour
    Decision Tree
    Support Vector Machine
    Logistic Regression

The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

    Jaccard index
    F1-score
    LogLoss
